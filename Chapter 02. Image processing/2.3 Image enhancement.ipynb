We have already explored one of them in notebook *2.1 IP tools*: (linear) Look-Up Tables (LUTs). In this notebook we will play with other two:\n\n- Non-linear look-up tables (<a href=\"#231\">Section 2.3.1</a>).\n- Histogram equalization (<a href=\"#232\">Section 2.3.2</a>).\n- Histogram specification (<a href=\"233\">Section 2.3.3</a>).\n\nAlso, some color-space conversions are going to be needed. If you are not familiar with the YCrCb color space, **Appendix 2: Color spaces** contains the information you need to know about it.\n\n## Problem context - Implementing enhancement techniques for an image editor tool\n\nWe have all tried an image editor tool, sometimes without even knowing it! For example, modern smartphones already include an application for applying filters to images, cut them, modify their contrast, brightness, color temperature, etc. \n\n<img src=\"./images/GIMP-logo.png\" width=\"200\">\n\n\nOne example of open source tool is the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). Quoting some words from its [website](https://www.gimp.org/):  \n\n> GIMP is a cross-platform image editor available for GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows and more operating systems. It is free software, you can change its source code and distribute your changes.\n> Whether you are a graphic designer, photographer, illustrator, or scientist, GIMP provides you with sophisticated tools to get your job done. You can further enhance your productivity with GIMP thanks to many customization options and 3rd party plugins.\n\n\nIn this case we were contacted by UMA for implementing two techniques to be included in their own image editor tool! Concretely, we were asked to develop and test two methods that are also part of GIMP: [**gamma correction**](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-tool-levels.html) and [**equalize**](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-layer-equalize.html)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\nfrom ipywidgets import interactive, fixed, widgets\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20.0, 20.0)\n\nimages_path = './images/'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.3.1 Non-linear look-up tables <a id=231></a>\n\n**Gamma correction**, or often simply **gamma**, is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in video or still image systems. In other words, it is the result of applying an (already defined) **non-linear LUT** in order to stretch or shrink image intensities.\n\nIn this way, the gamma LUT definition for grayscale images, where each pixel $i$ takes values in the range $[0 \\dots 255]$, is:\n\n$$LUT(i) = (\\frac{i}{255})^{\\gamma} * 255, \\ \\gamma \\gt 0 $$\n\nThe following images illustrate the application of gamma correction for different values of $\\gamma$.\n\n<img src=\"./images/gamma_theory.jpg\" width=\"800\" >"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **<span style=\"color:green\"><b><i>ASSIGNMENT 1: Applying non-linear LUTs</i></b></span>**\n\nYour task is to develop the `lut_chart()` function, which takes as arguments the image to be enhanced and a gamma value for building the non-linear LUT. It will also display a chart containing the original image, the gamma-corrected one, the used LUT and the histogram of the resulting image.\n\nAs users from UMA will use color images, you will have to **implement it for color images**. This can be done by:\n1. **transforming** a image in the BGR color space **to the YCrCb one**,\n2. then, **applying gamma LUT only to first band** of the YCrCb space (that's because it contains pixel intensities and you can handle it like a gray image), and\n3. finally, as matplotlib displays RGB images (if verbose is True), it should be **converted back**. Also, return the resultant image.\n\n*Interesting functions:* \n- [`np.copy()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.copy.html): method that returns a copy of the array provided as input.\n- [`cv2.LUT()`](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#gab55b8d062b7f5587720ede032d34156f): *function that  performs a look-up table transform of an array of arbitrary dimensions.*\n- [`plt.hist()`](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html) *function that computes and draws the histogram of an array.
